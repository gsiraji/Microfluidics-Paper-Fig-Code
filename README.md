# Microfluidics-Paper-Fig-Code
All the code used to generate figures in the microfluidics paper

A description of each file:

1. vid_process.m generates figure 5. To create the exact figure, the following 2 files must be available: 'vid_data.xlsx' manually tracked f data and 'du.mp4' the experiment video. 


2. ode_jump.m generates figures 4 and 8 by running a stochastic simulation of clogging for 3 devices with different number of columns and solving the ODE system numerically. It does not require any additional files to run.


3. single_column_plots.m generates figures 2 and 6- stochastic simulation of clogging for single-column devices. It does not require any additional files to run.


4. clog_sim_n_columns.m generates versions of figures 3 and 7. This file performs stochastic simulation of clogging for constant total flow and constant pressure difference. Collects the clogging time and fraction of clogged channels at the time of clogging and creates plots. The case of constant total flow rate (c_mode == 0) requires the files 'nb_cf_theory_qQ0.xlsx' and 'nb_cf_theory_q2Q0.xlsx' generated by running the mathematica notebook 'cf_hybrid_n_columns.nb'


5. 'cf_hybrid_n_columns.nb' is the Mathematica notebook that calculates the hybrid theory results for the multiple-column devices with constant total flow. It saves the data in an Excel file to be used by matlab in MATLAB plots
